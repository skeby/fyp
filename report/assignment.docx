1.	Analyzing the relationships between learners’ motivation and observable engaged behaviors in a gamified learning environment
This study examines the influence of gamification on learner motivation, expression of effort, and willingness to continue with a digital learning platform. Based on data from 257 age-13–14 students from four middle schools, the research distinguishes between two kinds of behavioral engagement: achievement-oriented and perfection-oriented. Achievement-oriented engagement refers to learners who start off with intrinsic motivation and a desire to do well in the quiz on their first attempt. Learners redo quizzes to get a better score, which is engagement for perfection. The study concludes that while gamification can reduce the intrinsic motivation of high achievers, it also increases extrinsic motivation for mutual-motivated players.
2.	An attrition model for MOOCS: evaluating the learning strategies of gamification
Survey results recognized factors of high dropout rates like time constraints, the difficulty of the course, and lack of support. The second one introduces AMOES [Attrition Model for Open Learning Environment Setting] to study the behavior of learners and differentiate healthy from unhealthy attrition. Keskin et al. (2020) emphasizes in this paper the critical factor of motivation within the learning process while detailing different gamification methods, such as badges, leaderboards, and reward systems, to improve student participation. The findings imply that while gamification may help enhance motivation and decrease undesirable attrition, reaching a desired level of effectiveness with this approach may require carefully designing gamified learning environments according to learner profiles. Finally, the research ends with advice for future studies and enhancing gamified teaching styles.
